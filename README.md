About:
In this homework we were to Create a Node application, which allows the user to create a team of managers, engineers, and interns that outputs an HTML document. Using app.js it prompts the user to answer a series of questions about their individual roles. Once this is completed on the backend, it then stores each answer the user has been stored as an object inside of an array. From there  I run a render file, which takes the information from the employees, and prints it onto a template. I then use fs to write the template to a file, team.html, in the output folder.


Technologies:
    1)Npm Inquirer Package-This was used to ask the user there name,github, email and role as well as id. //
    2)Html//
    3)Java Script
    4) html renderer
    5)app.js
